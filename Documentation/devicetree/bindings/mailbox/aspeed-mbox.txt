ASpeed Mailbox Driver
=====================

The ASpeed mailbox allows for communication between different
processors. The mailbox on the ASpeed ast2400 and ast2500 is a set of
16 single byte data registers along with interrupt and configuration
registers directly on the SoC. These are memory mapped on the aspeed
and can be accessed via the SuperIO registers on the other processor.

Device Node:
============
This represents the mailbox on the Soc.

As the mailbox registers sit on the LPC bus, it makes most sense for
the device to be within the LPC host node. See
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mfd/aspeed-lpc.txt for more
information. This does not have to be the case, provided the reg
property can give the full address of the mbox registers.

Required Properties:
--------------------
- compatible:	Should be one of the following,
				"aspeed,ast2400-mbox" for ast2400 SoCs
				"aspeed,ast2500-mbox" for ast2500 SoCs

- reg:			Contains the mailbox address register range (base
				address and length). Keeping in mind that if the node
				exists within the LPC host node and that base is
				relative to that.

- interrupts:	Contains interrupt information for the mailbox device.

- #mbox-cells:	Common property, should be 1.

Example:
--------

mbox: mbox@180 {
	compatible = "aspeed,ast2400-mbox";
	reg = <0x180 0x5c>;
	interrupts = <46>;
	#mbox-cells = <1>;
};
